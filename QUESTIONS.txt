APDCAM10G_control.getDualSATA() returns whether dual sata or not, without checking same for ADCs. This status should be shown somewhere in the GUI (or controlled as well?)

fir frequency: ebbol ki lesz szamolva a coeff-ek. Keruljon be azok melle. 

QSpinBox - changes should take immediate effect?
for clock, stb, ne menjen egybol kamerara. Fir maradhat. 

ADC set offsets - changed to board-by-board control
legyen egy olyanm, ami osszes adc osszes channelje. 

APDCAM10G_control.setADCDualSATA is now for all boards. Should it be like this? Then update the gui
igen, maradjon igy, factory beallitas, es board-onkent legyen (implementalni apdcam10g_control-ban. )

AdcControl has an "Internal trigger" checkbox globally, and also for all channels individually.

Should Int. Fitler be renamed IIR Filter? Should FIR and IIR coeffs go to the same block? What is divide? Can we use arrayDAta=True write for all coeffs in one go? (doc says we must write sequentially, values are sent to the fpga after writing coeff8)

APDCAM10G_control class has HV_conversion_in and HV_conversion_out, used at one place. In setHV method, however, HV_conversion is used, which is only set from the GUI.
