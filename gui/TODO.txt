- print the serial number of ADC boards and PC board upon connection
- MainPage: show interface obtained automatically.
- Connect-disconnect-connect kills the app
- LED1, LED2 - what are these? Apparently not SATA1/SATA2 data out
- read settings from last saved settings file upon connection,
- ADC/Test pattern: combo box for pre-set values. Ask Sanyi.
- FIR/Rec frequency --> coeffs. Ask Sanyi about the formula/code
- ADC: "Read all ADC status" should be removed
- ADC: Enable trigger/channel, crashes, o
- ADC frequency: Mult/Div/Freq: frequency should not go above 30 MHz. Less values should be displayed.
- Control timing/ Frequencies: Show reference frequency (20 MHz for first two rows, measured ext freq. for 3rd row, ADC freq for 4th row), and actual values in 5th column
- Control timing / Locked panel: tooltips. "Basic PLL Locked" --> ADC clock (internal) valid. "Ext. DCM Locked" --> External ADC frequency valid. "SATA Pll Locked" --> SATA frequency valid
- Camera configuration panel should be merged to Main
